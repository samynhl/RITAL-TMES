       " 'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \\nfirst , there\\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \\nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \\nno no . . . \\njust kidding . \\nhad you going there for a moment , didn\\'t i ? \\nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \\nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \\nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \\nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \\nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \\ni\\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \\nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\\'t try to overachieve . \\nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \\nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \\nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \\nshao khan has decided that he\\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \\nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \\none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \\ntoo bad they didn\\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \\ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \\n * the acting is truly bad . \\nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \\n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \\nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \\ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \\n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \\n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \\nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \\n . . . unless you\\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \\nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \\n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \\nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \\nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \\n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \\nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \\na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \\n * there aren\\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \\nsilly , silly folks . \\nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \\nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \\n * the special effects are generally better , except for

\\ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \\ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \\nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \\nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \\nthen there\\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\\'s earlier \" carlito\\'s way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \\nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \\nhe\\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\\'t so formulaic . \\na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \\nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \\nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \\nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\\'d be given , and perhaps he\\'d have to make a choice between who\\'s he has to believe . \\nnow there\\'s a film . \\nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \\n',\n",

reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong\\'s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . \\nsuch talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . \\nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . \\nunfortunately \" romeo must die \" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong\\'s rhythms . \\nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . \\nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . \\nkai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) ,

murder . \\nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . \\nhung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . \\nescaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother\\'s death . \\n \" romeo must die \" is in many ways a fun film . \\nit is both absurd and assured . \\nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes \" the godfather \" . \\nthe relationship between jet li\\'s han and aaliyah\\'s trish o\\'day reminds us of abel ferrera\\'s \" china girl \" , except that romeo must die\\'s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \\ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \\nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \\nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \\nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \\nit\\'s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \\nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \\ndelro lindo as issac o\\'day carries himself well in the film . \\nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \\nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac\\'s son , colin . \\nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \\nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \\nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \\nhaving a career as one of the industry\\'s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . \\nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \\nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \\nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \\nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah\\'s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \\nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \\njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \\none needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \\nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet\\'s u . s . debut ) didn\\'t allow . \\nunfortunately , a lot of jet\\'s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \\nalso \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \\nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba\\'s \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \\nit\\'s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \\none problem though about the fight scenes . \\nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \\nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \\na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \\nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \\nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \\nhere in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . \\nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \\nthe rhythm is monotonous . \\na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \\n\\'rmd\\' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \\na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan\\'s films . . \\nwatch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \\nnow look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . \\nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn\\'t let the audience catch its breath . \\nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \\nhere in \\'romeo must die\\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \\njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \\nit\\'s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \\none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity .

\\nno , but i expected something . \\na funny joke . \\na clever prank . \\na plot development . \\nanything . \\nthe movie never delivers . \\nyou\\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \\n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\\'s existence , and it\\'s not a very satisfying realization . \\nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \\nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \\nthey have a garage band . \\nthey\\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \\nthey have tickets , they lose them . \\nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \\nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \\nthere\\'s not much more to it . \\nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \\noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \\nshe doesn\\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\\'t figured that out already . \\nit\\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \\nwe\\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \\nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \\n \" detroit rock city \" doesn\\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \\nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \\nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\\'s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor\\'s cat coughed up ) . \\nit\\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\\' s evident that they\\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \\nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \\npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \\ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \\ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \\nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \\nit\\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \\ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \\ni haven\\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \\nand what about that script ? \\nit\\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\\'ve ever heard . \\nif it is , i can\\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\na plotless , pointless rock n\\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\nit\\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\nfunny ! \" \\nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \\ntwice . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \\nsee ? \\nfunny ! \\na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren\\'t funny all by themselves . \\nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn \\'t predicted them five minutes in advance . \\nthat\\'s it , i\\'ve said enough about this movie . \\nit\\'s a waste of time and money . \\ni liked the music , but don\\'t bother buying the soundtrack . \\ni hear it\\' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \\nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \\ngo rent roger corman\\'s 1979 classic \" rock n\\' roll high school . \" \\nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . \\nyes , go rent that , and skip \" detroit rock city , \" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . \\n',\n",

\\nif we can\\'t take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don\\'t care what happens to them . \\ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . \\nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here\\'s a behemoth running through the city ! \\nthere\\'s bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . \\njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm\\'s way just in time . \\nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . \\nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . \\nit\\'s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . \\nconsider another punch pulled . \\nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn\\'t just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . \\nit made me want to gag . \\nemmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . \\nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . \\nhowever , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn\\'t work . \\nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . . \\n',\n",

       " 'another formula \\'feel good\\' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like \" waking ned devine , \" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \\nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \\nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \\nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \\nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \\nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the \\'war on drugs\\' is about to be escalated into colombia . \\nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america\\'s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america\\'s drug usage and drug supply . \\nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \\neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \\nthe film\\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \\nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \\nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \\nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \\nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \\nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \\nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \\nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \\neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \\nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \\nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \\nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \\nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \\nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \\nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \\nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \\nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \\nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \\nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \\nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \\nthis \\'unhip\\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \\nummm !

\\na few months later , volcano was released . \\nthe first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . \\nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . \\nwell , it\\'s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . \\nthis time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . \\nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante\\'s peak . \\nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . \\napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . \\nto be completely honest , i haven\\'t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . \\nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . \\ndeep impact doesn\\'t just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . \\nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . \\ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . \\na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . \\namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . \\nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . \\nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . \\na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . \\nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \\nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \\nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \\nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \\nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \\nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \\nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \\nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \\nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \\nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \\nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \\nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival . \\na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \\nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won\\'t kill off the entire human race . \\nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \\nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \\njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \\nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \\nit\\'s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \\nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \\nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \\nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won\\'t work . \\ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er . \" \\nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \\nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \\nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \\nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \\nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \\nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it\\'s that boring . \\nof course , leder isn\\'t all to blame for it . \\nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \\nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \\nchock full of cheesy one liners ( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) \\nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \\nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \\nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can\\'t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \\nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \\nthat\\'s right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . \\nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \\nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \\nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that\\'s forgiveable . \\nwhat isn\\'t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \\ngive me a break , will ya ? \\nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \\nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \\nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \\ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \\nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \\njust when we think visual effects can\\'t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \\none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder\\'s direction , which also influences the actors . \\nleder loves to show the actors\\' faces before and during moments of terror . \\nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \\nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \\nleder likes to flaunt people\\'s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \\none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \\nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person\\'s face while drifting into space . \\nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \\non another note , leder\\'s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \\nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \\nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it\\'s obvious it will be emotional . \\nit\\'s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it didn\\'t work for me . \\nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \\nt ?

       " 'if there\\'s one thing i just can\\'t stand , it\\'s a film that oozes with sentimentality . \\nhere\\'s a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . \\nswelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . \\nalas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . \\nwhat reminded me was that i wasn\\'t choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . \\nmy giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word \" cute \" but i\\'ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a \" cute \" film here ) . \\nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . \\nmaybe it will work for some people . \\nit didn\\'t work for me . \\nbilly crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . \\nhe\\'s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . \\nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . \\nhis name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he\\'d be a great movie star because of his size . \\nsubplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he\\'s never around for them , so they move to chicago . \\nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . \\nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . \\nsam is broke . \\nmax is dying . \\npass the kleenex . \\nmy giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . \\nit has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . \\nin one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn\\'t believe that he\\'s actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . \\ncrystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he\\'s countered by a slew of jokes that aren\\'t funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . \\nmuresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can\\'t act very well . \\nquinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . \\nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . \\nhere , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . \\nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . \\nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . \\nsam\\'s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . \\nlater , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam\\'s reunion with his family . \\nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . \\nit\\'s icky . \\nit drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . \\nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . \\nmore importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . \\ninstead , it\\'s a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . \\nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . \\n',\n",

\\ni\\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \\ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \\nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \\ni knew the film wasn\\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \\nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \\ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \\nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \\nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \\nugh , i give up . \\ni\\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \\nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \\n[pg] \\n',\n",

       " 'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \\nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley\\'s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain\\'t ) . \\nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they\\'d dare tempt fate and go for another round . \\nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \\nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \\nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there\\'s a catch -- he\\'s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who\\'s now infected with alien dna . \\npatrick\\'s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \\nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick\\'s primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \\nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \\nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \\nmr . brancato\\'s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \\nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there\\'s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \\nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker\\'s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \\nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \\nand she\\'s not even empathic ! \\nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who\\'s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , \" he\\'s going to rape her . \" \\nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \\nthere\\'s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn\\'t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( \" he\\'s in aisle 1 ! \" \\ninforms eve ) . \\nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \\nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it\\'s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \\nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve\\'s brain ? \\nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \\nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \\nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it\\'s being foisted upon the public . \\nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there\\'s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \\nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick\\'s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \\nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \\nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she\\'s so empowered . \" \\na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that\\'s * what i call empowerment . \\n',\n",

       " 'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \\nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \\ni suppose i\\'m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\\'s early works . \\nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \\nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\\'s wing for years and years , i\\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \\nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \\nthe film seems to not only borrow it\\'s plot from last year\\'s similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \\'80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter\\'s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \\n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \\nthey get on . \\nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \\nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \\nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \\nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \\nand it\\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\\'t give a damn . \\ni almost don\\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \\nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \\'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \\nor peter o\\'toole in \" caligula . \" \\ngreat actor , horrific performance . \\nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland\\'s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \\nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone\\'s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it\\'s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \\n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it\\'s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \\nand if you don\\'t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there\\'s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don\\'t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \\nbut all of this doesn\\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \\nand my god , it\\'s a long damn sit . \\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\\'s a wonder that it even got made . \\nwe already know that big movie studios\\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \\nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \\n',\n",

       " 'watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute \\'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . \\nif the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \\nalas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \\nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \\nthat\\'s pretty generous , considering the movie\\'s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \\nwhen will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \\nso why such a seemingly high rating ? \\nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \\nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \\nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \\nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don\\'t necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \\nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie\\'s tension . \\ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \\ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i\\'ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \\nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \\nwilliam hurt isn\\'t too bad either . \\nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \\nand perhaps i shouldn\\'t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \\nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . \\nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \\nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \\nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \\nnow for the bad news . \\nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \\nit\\'s squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \\n \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . \\nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \\nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \\nthe story\\'s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what\\'s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \\nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \\nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will\\'s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to \\'evil . \\' \" \\nthen there\\'s the tone of the movie . \\nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \\nthen it could be an adventure movie . \\nthey\\'re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn\\'t a good enough actor to carry it off . \\nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \\njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn\\'t mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who\\'s the center of a family . \\nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \\nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \\nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \\nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \\nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \\nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \\nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \\nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \\nwhy ? \\nwhy bother saying what year this is . \\njust tell us it\\'s the future . \\ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \\nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won\\'t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \\nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \\nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny\\'s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven\\'t learned a thing about ergonomics . \\none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \\nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \\nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \\nbut if that\\'s the best part of the movie , i can\\'t in good conscience recommend it . \\nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \\n',\n",

swift\\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \\nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\\'s best if not his best . \\nwhen the film\\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\\'s new version is even less faithful . \\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the

not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \\nand the language they talk is earth- english . \\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \\nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \\nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\\'s visualization is really an improvement . \\nthese visuals work nicely . \\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \\ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n",

       " \"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \\nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \\nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \\nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \\ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \\nthe answer is just about everything . \\nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \\nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \\nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \\nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \\nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \\nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \\nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \\nhe's too much of a joker . \\ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \\nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \\nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \\nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \\nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \\none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \\nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \\nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \\nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \\nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \\nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \\nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \\nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \\nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \\nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \\nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \\ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \\nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \\nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \\nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \\nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \\n\",\n",

       " 'shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . \\nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . \\nthat is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . \\nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . \\nthe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . \\nphilip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . \\nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . \\nhowever , to directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \" \\nthrough a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . \\nso , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . \\nhowever , the young writer has a severe case of writer\\'s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . \\nhe has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate\\'s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can\\'t seem to put words to paper . \\nthen , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer\\'s block . \\nthere are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . \\nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it\\'s author . \\nironically , that couldn\\'t be truer here . \\nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . \\none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . \\nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character\\'s name in the credits . \\nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth\\'s theatres . \\njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . \\nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . \\ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . \\nhowever , the supporting cast does almost save the day . \\ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . \\nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . \\nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn\\'t qualify as real acting . ) . \\nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . \\nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . \\nwhen all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . \\nhowever , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn\\'t necessarily quality . \\nand this certainly isn\\'t quality . \\nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . \\nsimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \\n',\n",

\\nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . \\nthis all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . \\nand in the end , he failed . \\nto make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . \\nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . \\nwe get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . \\nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . \\nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . \\nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . \\nterrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . \\nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . \\nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . \\nhe had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . \\nrather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . \\nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . \\nthey offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data . \\nwigand\\'s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . \\nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . \\nin spite of the secrecy , wigand\\'s former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . \\nand so the game begins . \\nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . \\nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . \\nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . \\nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . \\nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . \\nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . \\nthe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . \\nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . \\nthe musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . \\nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . \\nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . \\nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . \\nthis film might have been a really engaging experience under another director\\'s control . \\nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . \\ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n",

\\nafter surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . \\n \" maybe it won\\'t be * that * bad \" he may say to himself . \\n \" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . \\nwatchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . \\nit stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . \\nlou rawls is even in the mix ! \" \\nunfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . \\nthe latter is really too bad . \\nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . \\nkoontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . \\npeople who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . \\nit\\'s definately not a koontz book if there isn\\'t ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people\\'s eyeballs . \\nwatchers has all three devices , which may explain why it\\'s arguably the most popular of koontz\\'s books . \\nthe idea behind koontz\\'s novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . \\nbasically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target\\'s position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat . \\nsilly but kind of neat too . \\ni\\'m sorry . \\ni don\\'t mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . \\ni suppose i just don\\'t want to talk about the movie itself . \\nthis turkey is really cheesy . \\nno one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it\\'s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . \\nthe cheese factor is only increased when he\\'s involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she\\'s-supposed-to-be whom he befriends . \\nmercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . \\nto be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . \\nyou know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . \\ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . \\nand the creature ! \\nyes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . \\nthis creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it\\'s okay . \\nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . \\noh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . \\ncheesy gore . \\nthat\\'s another main element of watchers reborn . \\nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film\\'s campiness rather than its suspense . \\nultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film\\'s silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it\\'s an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . \\nalso , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . \\nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . \\nfinally , i couldn\\'t help but think that watchers reborn would work well as \" bot fodder \" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , \" mystery science theater 3000 . \" \\nthis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face . \\nrated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore . \\nit also has violence , obviously . \\ni wouldn\\'t recommend it for the little kids , but i\\'m sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . \\ninstead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz\\'s book . \\ntrust me , it\\'ll be time much , much better spent . \\n',\n",

       " ' \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \\nthat\\'s right . \\nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \\nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon\\'s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he\\'s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \\nit\\'s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn\\'t playing like he\\'s autistic . \\nunlike dustin hoffman\\'s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio\\'s in \" what\\'s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character\\'s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \\nhell , he doesn\\'t even have to be shy . \\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis\\' arm . \\nwillis\\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon\\'s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \\nof course , we know that isn\\'t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon\\'s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \\nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \\ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey\\'s character is far too accommodating . \\nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o\\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn\\'t rise to the challenge . \\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it\\'s more suspenseful that way . \\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it\\'s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \\n',\n",

       " 'while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . \\nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . \\nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it\\'s a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you\\'ve seen the animated series on hbo you\\'ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he\\'s been sent to hell . \\ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . \\nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . \\nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . \\nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . \\nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . \\nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry . \\nand as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . \\nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . \\ninevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . \\nhence , jason\\'s mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil\\'s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . \\nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol\\' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . \\ntime passes . \\nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . \\nthis character is merely a poor man\\'s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . \\nnow the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil\\' vs evil . \\nand evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . \\njohn leguizamo\\'s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film\\'s relief point . \\nall this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . \\nand then there\\'s martin sheen . \\nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . \\nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . \\nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . \\nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . \\ni\\'d never thought i\\'d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen\\'s career is in better shape . \\nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . \\nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . \\nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . \\ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . \\nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . \\nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . \\nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . \\nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton\\'s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . \\nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him . \\nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . \\nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he\\'s fatigued about being normal . \\nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . \\nnone of this is present in spawn . \\nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner\\'s . \\nas an example of this film\\'s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . \\nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that\\'s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . \\nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . \\nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . \\nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . \\nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . \\nchildren are

       " \"i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . \\nmichael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof . \\nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) . \\ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes . \\nthese are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences . \\nit appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line . \\nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words . \\nbut , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest . \\nit's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor . \\nfor the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk . \\nwish me luck . \\nfirst and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport . \\nwhile i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke . \\nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions . \\nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character . \\nthey meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there . \\nit's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis . \\nbut now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? \\nenough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience . \\nit's stupid , pointless and repetitive . \\ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone . \\naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited . \\nand those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks . \\ndon't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs . \\nit's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced . \\nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed . \\nit's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure . \\ncoburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie . \\nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film . \\nthings get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat . \\nif that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover . \\ntheir crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here . \\nwait , maybe the only big laughs . . . \\ni'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk . \\ni can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that . \\ni suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate . \\nbut hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . \\n\",\n",
       " 'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \\nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \\nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \\nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \\nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \\nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \\nboring . \\nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\\'s lifelessness . \\n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \\nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \\nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \\nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \\nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \\nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \\neven whit stillman\\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \\ndancing isn\\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\\'s fault . \\nfrom what i\\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\\'s legend . \\nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \\nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \\nthey fail on both counts . \\nultimately , _54_\\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \\nas in , there isn\\'t any to be had for the audience . \\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \\nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \\nthey\\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \\nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \\n',\n",

       " 'a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . \\nit\\'s jeroen krabb ? \\'s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can\\'t forget their bitter past . \\nthe heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . \\nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . \\nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . \\nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can\\'t locate them now due to all the changes in the city . \\nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents\\' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . \\nthe hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don\\'t go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . \\nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn\\'t talk . \\nthe stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . \\nto hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn\\'t gone away there\\'s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . \\nthe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman\\'s book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . \\nit starts off telling chaja\\'s story of how she\\'s a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can\\'t be forgotten . \\nthe effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . \\nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja\\'s parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . \\nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . \\ntopol\\'s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . \\nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can\\'t love : it starts out by showing how under chaja\\'s loving care he\\'s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying \\'quack , quack\\' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . \\nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy\\'s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . \\ni felt i didn\\'t just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . \\nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . \\nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . \\nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . \\nunless i was mistaken and the film\\'s real aim was to make us cry over simcha . \\n',\n",

       " \"it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . \\nsome people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . \\nboth those films were tense exercises in chills . \\nthe two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . \\nbut that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . \\nfor most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . \\neach of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . \\nthey had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . \\nthe thrills all came from the plot . \\nronin is like a film made by another man . \\nsomewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . \\nwe get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure . \\nthe film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . \\nwhen a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . \\nif you miss the opening , do not worry . \\nthis film will explain again what a ronin is . \\nsam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . \\nhe is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . \\nhe clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . \\nsam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . \\ndierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . \\nsam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . \\nalso along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . \\nthe group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . \\ntheir only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . \\nthe story is not very easy to follow . \\nit is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . \\nsomehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . \\nsome very good actors are involved in this film . \\none wonders what they saw in the script . \\nthe characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . \\nthey know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . \\nby the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . \\nmaybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . \\nin addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . \\nas a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . \\nunfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . \\ni rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\nnon-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . \\nalso one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . \\nthis is the first blow of the 47 ronin . \\n\",\n",
       " 'the main problem with martin lawrence\\'s pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn\\'t seem to do anything except justify the woman\\'s actions . \\nthat is especially the case in lawrence\\'s darnell wright . \\nhe is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . \\nnow don\\'t think i condone this just because i\\'m male . \\nmy philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . \\ndarnell doesn\\'t think like this . \\nhe sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . \\nand by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , \" i\\'m supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? \" \\nafter all , it is largely darnell\\'s fault . \\nif he is lining up all these women , you\\'d think he\\'d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does . \\nbut he doesn\\'t , so you get the sense that he\\'s not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb . \\nyou especially get this sense that he\\'s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her . \\n ( i\\'d put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) \\nnow , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it\\'s hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage . \\none final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with . \\nbrandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell\\'s \" immature play \" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life . \\nbut all of a sudden she says yes . \\nbut when you listen to darnell\\'s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him ! \\nlawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies . \\nlook at this movie . \\nfour writers , as a result it\\'s too long ( two hours , when it could\\'ve easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn\\'t get along ) , all of which isn\\'t necessary . \\nthere are some bright spots , though . \\nwhitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot . \\nand there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they\\'re just not enough to sustain the film . \\n',\n",
       " 'capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness . \\npotentially interesting idea made stagy and boring . \\nclaire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice . \\nit\\'s a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e . \\nmovie , where s . f . e . \\nmeans so f * * * ing earnest . \\nmovies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing . \\nclaire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk . \\nclaire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer\\'s retreat . \\nclaire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior . \\nobviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that\\'s all they do : talk . \\nthe movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness . \\nthe evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she\\'s been hit with a sockful of wet sand . \\nthe movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively . \\n ( ugh ! ) \\nthe most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads . \\nall of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what\\'s just happened . \\nwe never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn\\'t even happen yet . \\nthe problem with claire . . . \\nis not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it\\'s handled . \\nwhy is it that any \" serious \" ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that\\'s unwatchably boring ? \\nthe way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids . \\nmany other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting . \\nlook at john sayles\\' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire . \\nwhat this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants . \\n',\n",
       " 'the great actor james woods once said ( and i\\'m paraphrasing ) , \" if sex isn\\'t messy , then you\\'re not doing it right \" . \\na truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace \" sex \" with \" your mad slasher film \" ) . \\nfor those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . \\nurban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . \\nfor film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) \" if you can\\'t scare your audience , gross em\\' out , if you can\\'t do that , make em\\' laugh \" . \\nalas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . \\ni actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . \\nit seems that audiences\\' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . \\nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . \\nunfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don\\'t need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . \\nif anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . \\nbut forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . \\nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . \\nthese flicks aren\\'t harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? \\nsadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . \\nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . \\ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . \\nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend\\'s setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . \\nyou see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . \\nall those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . \\nall the better for that elusive crazed killer . \\ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . \\nbut alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it\\'s way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . \\nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . \\nit\\'s the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . \\nit\\'s the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . \\ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing . \\nyes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn\\'t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . \\ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . \\napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . \\nin scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man\\'s rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity . \\nfor urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . \\nthough i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . \\nthe film\\'s killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they\\'re coming from inside the house ) . \\ni won\\'t spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . \\nsad to say , it doesn\\'t include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . \\nnow that would be scary . \\nbefore i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i\\'ve ever spent an evening with . \\nonly jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . \\nthe most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . \\nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . \\nafter all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can\\'t stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can\\'t stand not getting slaughtered . \\n',\n",

       " 'here\\'s something to chew on : what\\'s the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? \\nthe obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that\\'s the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . \\ndeep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . \\nin fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . \\nthe most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . \\nnot since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . \\nwe learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers . \\ni suppose deep rising\\'s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn\\'t do much for me . \\non the surface , and that\\'s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . \\nin going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . \\nthe film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . \\nin fact , it\\'s downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron\\'s current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . \\nis it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? \\nprobably not , since it\\'s easy to guess , but i\\'ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . \\nthe film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . \\nin addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there\\'s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat\\'s pilot , who\\'s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o\\'connor ) , the inept sidekick who\\'s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the \" mastermind \" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . \\ntheir goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes . \\nthe problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . \\naside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there\\'s no one on board . \\nthe reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . \\nthe cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad\\'s cinque ) . \\nwilliams , once a \" can\\'t miss \" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . \\nfamke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . \\ngiven her limited acting abilities , it\\'s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . \\nunfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture . \\nmeanwhile , kevin j . o\\'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . \\nthese days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . \\nthis is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn . \\nthe days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . \\nnow , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it\\'s impossible to tell where they end and where \" reality \" begins . \\nin deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . \\nunfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn\\'t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . \\neven once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won\\'t be the last of its kind . \\nlike the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . \\nand that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . \\n',\n",

\\nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \\npretty much like jan de bont ( \" twister \" , \" haunting \" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \\nhe was responsible for several good films ( \" basic instinct \" and \" starship troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" showgirls \" , \" total recall \" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \\nin a way \" hollow man \" fits perfectly in this collection . \\nit\\'s not better or worse than verhoven\\'s average film . \\nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \\nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot\\'s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \\nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ?

\\nthe answer is simple . \\nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \\nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \\nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \\nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \\nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \\nit\\'s all flesh and bones , but no soul . \\na void where its imagination should be . \\n',\n",

       " 'since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993\\'s steven spielberg drama \" schindler\\'s list \" and directed 1993\\'s intelligent \" searching for bobby fischer , \" his new film , \" a civil action , \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \\nwhat doesn\\'t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \\nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \\nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children\\'s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \\njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families\\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city\\'s drinking water . \\nsuddenly , after hearing about the families\\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \\nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods\\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \\ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \\nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \\nwatching the film , i couldn\\'t help but notice its similarities with 1997\\'s far , far superior film \" the sweet hereafter , \" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \\nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \\nnot only was the plotting similar to \" a civil action , \" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \\nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful \" a sweet hereafter \" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm\\'s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \\nin \" a civil action , \" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \\nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \\nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta\\'s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn\\'t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \\nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \\nyou\\'ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents\\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what \" a civil action \" does . \\nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \\naside from one flashback to when a man\\'s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \\ni could say the performances were good , but who\\'s fooling who ?

michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . \\ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . \\nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator\\'s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . \\napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator\\'s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . \\nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . \\nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . \\nmore time needed to be spent on white\\'s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . \\na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . \\neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it\\'s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . \\nsheen\\'s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . \\nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . \\nmtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . \\nflames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . \\ncogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . \\nhe goofily tells the audience , at one point , that \" how much of [spawn\\'s] humanity is left remains to be seen , \" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . \\nthe music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . \\nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . \\nto be fair , however , marilyn manson\\'s \" long hard road out of hell \" effectively compliments spawn\\'s return to earth , while filter and the crystal method\\'s \" ( can\\'t you ) trip like i do \" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . \\nfor as good a comic book as it is , \" spawn \" did not spawn a good movie . \\nspawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . \\nit receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . \\nmany other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . \\nrated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn\\'t be appropriate for the very young . \\n',\n",
       " 'i can\\'t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \\nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \\nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \\nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \\nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \\nred\\'s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d\\'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie\\'s dreams . \\nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam\\'s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie\\'s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \\nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn\\'t ready to let them go without a fight . \\nfreddie , meanwhile , isn\\'t ready to let sam\\'s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \\nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam\\'s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \\nit does a great job of setting up jjaks\\' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves\\' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \\nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \\nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements\\' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . \\nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \\nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \\ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn\\'t expect what i got . \\nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \\nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \\nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \\nvincent d\\'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \\nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme\\'s something wild and neil jordan\\'s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn\\'t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \\ni don\\'t want to dismiss baigelman\\'s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \\nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can\\'t make his two halves into a whole . \\nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there\\'s not much funny about that . \\n',\n",

captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . \\nmurphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . \\nthe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . \\n \" metro \" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . \\ncars flip . \\ncars crash . \\ncars turn over . \\nand it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of \" speed , \" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . \\nthere are also some other good scenes in \" metro \" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . \\nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \\nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \\nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \\nthose are the scenes that make up \" metro , \" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \\nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in \" metro \" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \\nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \\nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \\ni hardly recognized him in \" metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \\nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \\nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \\nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \\nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in \" kiss of death . \" \\nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \\ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \\nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \\n \" metro \" is a no-nonsense movie . \\nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \\nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \\nbut who cares ? \\nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \\noh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . \\nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \\nif there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \\n \" metro \" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end . \\npaul haynes \" > \\n',\n",

       " \"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! \\nregardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . \\nyou have to see it and experience it for yourself . \\nhere's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . \\nyes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . \\nin fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . \\ndon't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . \\nit reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . \\nit also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . \\nit does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . \\nas i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . \\nnow , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess . \\ni don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . \\nfor the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . \\ni paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . \\ni don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . \\nray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem . \\nrob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . \\nlela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! \\nin fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . \\nin that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . \\nbut what a strange mess it is . \\nit was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . \\ncan this be the same man ? \\ni don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . \\nknock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . \\nfor instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . \\nwhy ? \\nwho knows . \\nwhat are the implications of this ? \\ni have no idea . \\nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \\nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \\nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \\nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \\nvan damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \\nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \\ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \\nthey're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \\nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . \\nlots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . \\nbut did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? \\ni hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . \\nknock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . \\nif it were boring , i'd give it zero stars . \\nbut it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . \\nit's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny . \\na bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . \\ni recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm . \\noh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . \\nit's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful . \\n\",\n",

\\nwhy did tim robbins\\' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? \\nshouldn\\'t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? \\nwhy are the characters such idiots ? \\nbecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . \\nall the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it\\'s too bad you can\\'t go on this mission because you were determined \\'psychologically inadequate\\' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together \" -- does anyone really talk like this ? \\ncan\\'t we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? \\nthe whole film is like that . \\nthe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what\\'s going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we\\'re looking at * every * time . \\nsample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there\\'s mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that\\'s mars ? \" \\nastronaut a : \" yeah , that\\'s mars all right . \" \\nastronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" \\nthat exchange isn\\'t actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn\\'t be surprised if it were . \\nfor all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven\\'t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don\\'t tell . \\nde palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . \\nthis is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won\\'t get what\\'s going on , so they explain everything five times over . \\nfourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . \\nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i\\'m just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . \\ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . \\narmin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . \\nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . \\nand sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . \\nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . \\nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . \\nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . \\nsupposedly we\\'re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . \\nme , i alternated between the two . \\nthere is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . \\n',\n",

       " 'renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star\\'s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . \\ntsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . \\nwriter steven e . desouza\\'s fairly straightforward plotline isn\\'t as outre as _double_team_\\'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . \\nvan damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . \\nit\\'s all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . \\n . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . \\nwhile all of van damme\\'s films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting \" skills \" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme\\'s embarrassing directorial effort , 1996\\'s _the_quest_ ) . \\na lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : \" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! \" \\nand \" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! \" \\nstanding out among my favorites . \\nbut it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_\\'s laughs . \\nvan damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual . \\nearly scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus\\'s business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . \\neven typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . \\npaul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider\\'s cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode . \\nin rochon\\'s defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage . \\ntsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work . \\nhere , though , tsui\\'s visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise . \\nfor each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous . \\nthis is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . \\nfor instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . \\nas he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen . \\nit\\'s undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . \\nthe test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . \\ntsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . \\nthere isn\\'t anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui\\'s legendary hong kong works ( but that\\'s a given going in ) . \\nif tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo\\'s stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . . \\nbefore it\\'s too late . \\nif he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . . \\nthat is , if it hasn\\'t already disappeared entirely after this fiasco . \\n',\n",

       " 'in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \\nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \\ni liked that scene for two reasons . \\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \\nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \\nit\\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \\n ( it\\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \\nit shouldn\\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \\nanyway , the deceased lawyer\\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \\nif this weren\\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\\'t know how to act in our society . \\nit also doesn\\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \\nand as played by brad pitt , he\\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\\'s just there . \\nit\\'s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \\nit\\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \\ni\\'ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\\'s performance with this year\\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\\'s in city of angels . \\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\\'s character is so shallow that she can\\'t see beyond pitt\\'s good looks . \\nthe movie\\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\\'t save meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins isn\\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \\nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \\n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\\'s character more realistically evil . ) \\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\\'m sure . \\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\\'m asking myself why . \\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\\'m going to do now . \\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \\ndon\\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .

\\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ?

\\njb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . \\none entry was definitely enough , and i\\'m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . \\nit\\'s worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . \\ni should also mention that this movie likely won\\'t play all that well in cleveland . \\nnow that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . \\nactually , most of the action involves the twins\\' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . \\nhc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . \\nleading off this inning is john warren . \\nhe steps into the batter\\'s box and takes kent\\'s pitch low for ball one . \\nwh : so , the story\\'s strictly minor league , right ? \\nwhat\\'s it about ? \\njb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . \\nwhen twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to \" the show . \" \\nwith the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . \\nin fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) . \\nsoon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus\\' overachieving group against huff\\'s overpaid , last-place bunch . \\nwh : can we guess who wins ?

\\njb : not one , from start to finish . \\ni enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . \\nokay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . \\nthe two sequels haven\\'t just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . \\neven bob uecker\\'s once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they\\'re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . \\nhc : here\\'s the 1-1 pitch . \\nlooooooong drive ?

\\nlike cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . \\njb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . \\nthere aren\\'t any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . \\nyeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can\\'t throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ?

       " 'it\\'s time to take cover . \\nafter a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . \\nin early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante\\'s peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . \\nof the two , i had heard that dante\\'s peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . \\nthe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . \\nthe town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . \\nflaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . \\nwe see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . \\nit is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . \\nsymbolism doesn\\'t get much more blatant than that . \\nwe learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . \\nharry survived , but his wife did not . \\na few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante\\'s peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . \\nthere harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante\\'s peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . \\nalthough the mayor doesn\\'t seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . \\nthey are afraid that harry\\'s presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante\\'s peak . \\nthey would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . \\nhowever , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . \\nthus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . \\nthis film contains a number of cliches . \\nthe amorous couple is one . \\nas soon as they doff their clothes , you know they\\'re going to die . \\nthe town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog . \\ncountless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable . \\nwatching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . \\nunfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible . \\nfor example , harry\\'s boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation . \\npaul basically tells the townsfolk that harry\\'s eruption predictions aren\\'t cause for alarm . \\nthis causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work . \\nwhen paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , \" cause this town\\'s in trouble and i\\'m the best man you\\'ve got . \" \\neven better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . \\nhe likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . \\nif the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won\\'t move and will allow itself to be cooked . \\n \" is that your recipe for frog soup ? \" \\nasks one of the team members . \\n \" it\\'s my recipe for disaster , \" responds harry . \\ndante\\'s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious . \\nour heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . \\nmayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , \" acid eats metal . \" \\nthanks for the tip . \\nwhen we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there\\'s a caption labeling it as such . \\nthis wouldn\\'t have been so bad if it weren\\'t for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , \" u . s . geological survey . \" \\ni suppose the caption is for people who can\\'t read signs . \\nalthough harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . \\nthere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . \\nwhen they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , \" why do they want to kiss ? \\nwere they even attracted to each other ? \" \\nif i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn\\'t even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . \\nwho does he think he is ? \\njames bond ? \\nthe eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . \\nthere are several \" warning signs \" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don\\'t feel as if they are leading up to anything . \\nfor example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot . \\na tremor occurs . \\ndoes he plunge headlong to his death ? \\nis he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? \\nno , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg . \\nthe sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well . \\nit wasn\\'t . \\none plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante\\'s peak . \\nin a disaster movie , there\\'s usually one guy who\\'s greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster . \\nit\\'s okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . \\nif you\\'re going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . \\nin dante\\'s peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don\\'t really try hard enough . \\nmaybe the mayor\\'s abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . \\nfor no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . \\nperhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . \\nthere are a couple of good things about this movie . \\nthe first is the scenery . \\nthere are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful . \\nthe second is the special effects . \\nthey are the closest i\\'ve ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption . \\nbut when elements which don\\'t speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you\\'d probably better rewrite the script . \\n',\n",
       " \"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \\na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \\nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \\nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \\na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \\nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \\nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \\nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \\nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \\nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \\ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \\nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \\nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \\none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \\ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \\nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \\nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \\nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \\nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \\nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \\nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \\ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \\n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \\nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \\nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \\none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \\nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \\nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \\nhow come he didn't get it ? \\nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \\nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \\nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \\nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \\nit's all handwaving . \\nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \\nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \\nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \\na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\",\n",
       " ' \" deep rising \" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . \\nwhile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring\\'s \" anaconda \" -- \" deep rising \" has no tongue to put in its cheek . \\nfolks , we\\'re only a month into the new year , and already here\\'s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . \\nmost of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen \" titanic , \" then maybe they\\'d have known to stay home ) when it\\'s attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . \\nthe only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . \\na mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . \\nbut what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . \\nthe main problem with \" deep rising \" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . \\nthe concept is \" leviathan \" meets \" titanic , \" with a dash of \" speed 2 \" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) \\nmeasure . \\nthis monster is equal parts \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" and \" the relic , \" knows how to open doors like the raptors from \" jurassic park \" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in \" anaconda . \" \\nsome of the attack sequences are straight out of \" jaws \" and \" alien . \" \\na scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of \" alien resurrection . \" \\nthere\\'s even a jet ski chase like \" hard rain . \" \\nand the list goes on . \\nwatching \" deep rising \" \\'s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . \\nwilliams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn\\'t believable . \\nan interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as \" goldeneye \" \\'s killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o\\'connor , as finnegan\\'s mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . \\ndjimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december\\'s \" amistad , \" pops up in a brief part . \\nhe needs to stay away from the water . \\nthe movie\\'s final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . \\nas if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn\\'t bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you\\'re really asking for it ) , \" deep rising \" is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . \\nand since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn\\'t out of the question . \\n',\n",
       " ' \" mandingo \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , \" a trashy potboiler \" that \" appeals only to the s&m crowd . \" \\nactually , i think \" mandingo \" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \\nit\\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \\nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \\none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \\nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \\naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \\nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \\nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \\nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \\nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his \" bed wench , \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \\nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \\nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had \" pleasured \" her before he did . \\nof course , it\\'s fine that he\\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a \" white lady , \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \\nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \\nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \\nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \\nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \\nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \\njudging only by the plot , \" mandingo \" is pure sexploitation . \\nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \\nwhen \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \\ndramatically , \" mandingo \" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\\'s mostly confused . \\nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \\nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \\nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \\nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but \" mandingo\\'s \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \\nsome tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\\'s not that easy . \\n \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \\nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \\nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on \" serpico . \" \\njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n',\n",

       " 'retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) \\na film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson \\ni once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as \" dim-witted \" . \\nand by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead . \\nalthough the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them . \\ntwo points in the movie\\'s favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure . \\nand like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction . \\nthe story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts . \\nfor reasons we won\\'t go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth . \\nthe medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) . \\nthat scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ? \\nand don\\'t cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they\\'re buried ? \\nanyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches . \\nfulci\\'s graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film\\'s flimsy script and plodding direction . \\nthe dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable . \\nnot bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious \" lets explain the plot \" type approach . \\nmccoll doesn\\'t have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch . \\nand the geezer ( the actor\\'s name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses . \\nchristopher george\\'s performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don\\'t care . \\nin fact we don\\'t care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn\\'t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond . \\nas a director , some of fulci\\' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here . \\nhe constantly uses extreme close-ups of people\\'s eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren\\'t capable of . \\nand despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film . \\nlong-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that\\'s quite frankly embarrassing . \\nfulci\\'s other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey . \\nfor completists only . \\n',\n",

       " \"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . \\nearlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . \\nand now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . \\nstarring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . \\nbesson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . \\nat first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . \\nafter seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . \\nwith the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . \\na timeless epic it is not . \\nbesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . \\non the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . \\nthere is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . \\njovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . \\njovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . \\nshe is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . \\njovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . \\nquite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . \\nthe script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . \\nfaye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . \\nall three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . \\nthe battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . \\nthere's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . \\neven his fellow troopers are petrified . \\n`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . \\nalmost too 90's , it seems . \\nthere's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' \\nsprinkled throughout the screenplay . \\ni was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . \\nthere's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . \\nit seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . \\nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . \\nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . \\nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . \\nduring these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . \\nit's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . \\n`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . \\nanyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . \\ndespite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy . \\n\",\n",

\" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ? \\nwill it have an emergency room ? \\nor is it just for mental patients ? \\nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ? \\nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch\\'s motives ( i think another character asks him how he\\'s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don\\'t explore or challenge patch\\'s ideas to any meaningful extent . \\nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . \\ni know nothing about him . \\nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . \\nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . \\nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . \\nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . \\nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . \\ni won\\'t tell you that you can\\'t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . \\ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . \\npatch adams is the cheapest of them all . \\n',\n",

s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is . \\nit features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life . \\neven attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn\\'t like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it\\'s even more self consciously \" dramatic \" . \\nusual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending . \\nnowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential . \\nthus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn\\'t see it coming , and i smiled . \\nhowever most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason . \\nor substance . \\nit\\'s just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be . \\neven the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like \" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction \" are clever . \\nat one point caan laments \" need is the ultimate monkey \" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said \" love is like hippo ass \" . \\ni\\'ve seen porno with better dialogue . \\nand some with better plot lines too . \\nbut rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) . \\ncaan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness . \\nbenicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering . \\nspeaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose . \\nnicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he\\'s only kept around for his cold presence . \\ntaye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene . \\nfor the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo\\'s ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns . \\nit\\'s vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about \" faggots \" migrating to los angeles . \\nyou know the routine . \\nthe final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at . \\nbut those gun shots sure crack like thunder . \\njust the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry\\'s fetishized smith and wesson . \\noh how far we\\'ve come . \\n',\n",

\\nno , so why add this extra running time to the film ? \\nthe answer : it looked cool . \\nor how about the \" atmosphere \" ? \\nthe beginning of the general\\'s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . \\nnice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn\\'t matter , for when the film\\'s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . \\nno attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . \\ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? \\ninstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . \\nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . \\nas i\\'ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn\\'t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . \\nbrenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest \" yes , sir \" s i\\'ve ever heard . \\nhe even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general\\'s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . \\nsunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . \\nboth characters are protagonists , but it\\'s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . \\ni could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , \" let\\'s do it again , but this time , i want more . \" \\ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . \\nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general\\'s aide , colonel fowler . \\ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . \\na far cry from his days as linc in \" the mod squad \" , i can\\'t help but think he was acting from west\\'s direction . \\na couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . \\nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped west\\'s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth\\'s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . \\nwoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people\\'s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . \\nhutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn\\'t overacting . \\ni haven\\'t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i\\'ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . \\nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . \\nevery time we\\'re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it\\'s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . \\ninstead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . \\nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . \\nwould\\'ve been over in a half hour . \\nthe film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . \\nliterally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . \\nthey both seem kind of happy . \\nmaybe they were driving away from simon west . \\n',\n",

       " '14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . \\nin 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . \\nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . \\ntwo years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . \\nnow , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . \\nthey\\'ve been cremated . \\nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . \\nthe premise is basically the same . \\nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . \\nhis wife ellen ( beverly d\\'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . \\nof course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn\\'t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . \\nthere isn\\'t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . \\nit\\'s really just a skit movie . \\nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . \\nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . \\nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . \\nvegas vacation comes off like the first . \\na good example of the latter would be last year\\'s black sheep . \\nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn\\'t really fit into a movie mold . \\nin these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . \\nhave a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . \\nsuch is the case with this movie\\'s mini-plots . \\nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold\\'s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d\\'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . \\nthe simple fact is : this movie isn\\'t funny . \\nat first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . \\nchase plays clark griswold really well . \\nhe made the character and he is the character . \\nd\\'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn\\'t show any signs of redemption . \\nas for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . \\nthe \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . \\nthey\\'re so generic , you\\'ll expect the credits to read \" girl #1 as audrey griswold \" . \\nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . \\nyes , it\\'s true that vegas vacation isn\\'t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . \\nfirst off , why did they leave off the national lampoon\\'s heading on the title ? \\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\nwowzers ! \\nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \\nlooking at the names , you\\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\\'s . \\nwell that\\'s not all . \\nthis guy also brought us 90\\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \\nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

\\nit's very bad to have paris against you . \\nthe story is standard action film stuff . \\nit's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . \\nclearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . \\nit's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . \\nthere are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . \\nthey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . \\nmelvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . \\nlike i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . \\nwhat makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . \\nit seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . \\nthen , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . \\nthen , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . \\nkeiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . \\nand scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . \\none of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . \\nthe scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny . \\nand since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . \\nthis is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . \\ncars land on tree branches and are supported by them . \\ncharacters betray each other without a second thought . \\ngrenades are thrown in tight places . \\npeople jump out of tall buildings and survive . \\npeople outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . \\nmost frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . \\nthey're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . \\nthe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . \\nthe acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . \\nphillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . \\nthe big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . \\nthe funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . \\nit's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . \\ndespite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . \\nyou can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . \\nif you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . \\n\",\n",

) \\napril\\'s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \\nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the \" circuitry \" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \\nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \\ni\\'m not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \\neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \\nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews \" . \\nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can\\'t help but feel like he had some serious intent . \\nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i\\'m afraid that it\\'s one that i just don\\'t get . \\ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \\nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \\nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \\ni\\'m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don\\'t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren\\'t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \\nagain , maybe i\\'m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \\nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \\ndespite the disturbing visuals , \" mom and apple pie \" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \\nspeaking of disturbing visuals , \" wedding bells ain\\'t ringing \" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \\n \" i\\'m a lesbian \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \\nit\\'s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \\nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o\\'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \\ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \\none particular musical number , \" lesbian rock \" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \\nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \\nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( \" lesbian rock \" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \\nonce the \" isle of lesbos reprise \" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \\nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \\nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \\nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \\nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \\nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \\nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \\ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \\nwait . aren\\'t gladiator films considered to be . . . \\noh , never mind . \\n',\n",

to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \\nnow , i for one can\\'t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \\na good comparison would

       " \"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . \\non the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . \\nthey need not have wasted their time . \\nthe movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . \\nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . \\ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . \\nkeep cool just isn't very funny . \\nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . \\nalthough the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . \\ntoo bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . \\nqu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . \\nhowever , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . \\nit was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . \\nyou see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . \\nat least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . \\ncinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . \\nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . \\nheadache , as i said . \\nthe film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . \\nthey used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . \\nthe first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . \\nof course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . \\nin the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . \\nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . \\nthere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . \\nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . \\nthe bookseller would be better off without her . \\nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . \\nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . \\nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . \\na friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . \\nalthough only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . \\nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . \\na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . \\nbut of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . \\nthere are a few things that keep cool does right . \\nas mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . \\nalthough it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . \\nin one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . \\nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . \\nthe nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . \\nwith every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . \\nunfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \\n\",\n",

       " 'the general\\'s daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we\\'ll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . \\nit\\'s confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . \\nthat , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . \\nthe punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general\\'s daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . \\nour hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army\\'s criminal investigation division . \\nhis latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . \\ncomplicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . \\ngeneral campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . \\nteamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain\\'s past that make the case ever more sordid . \\nif only the sordidness were the worst of the general\\'s daughter\\'s problems . \\nscenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . \\ndirector simon west likely thinks he\\'s covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film\\'s fatal flaw . \\nit\\'s a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story\\'s few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . \\ncharacters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell\\'s still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . \\nwest just can\\'t help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general\\'s daughter . \\nhe even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . \\nbubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . \\nthe slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell\\'s mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . \\nthere\\'s something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . \\nindeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : \" shouldn\\'t you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? \" ) . \\neven the lame device of brenner and sunhill\\'s sexual history provides a few winning zingers . \\ngoldman\\'s dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you\\'ll find in most so-called comedies . \\ndialogue , unfortunately , just isn\\'t enough to make a quality script . \\nit\\'s difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . \\nby the time the general\\'s daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west\\'s heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . \\nit\\'s silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . \\ngoldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine . \\n',\n",
       " 'cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins . \\nwhile he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here . \\nthe story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i\\'ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible . \\nthe film is based on a \" mostly \" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down . \\nit\\'s during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor . \\nbetween this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated . \\nalso along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience . \\ntim robbin\\'s just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out . \\nfor robbin\\'s it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits . \\ni thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few . \\nlet me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it\\'s the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) . \\ni\\'ll begin with those involved with the play . \\nthere\\'s orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock . \\noutside the play there\\'s the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who\\'s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . \\nthere\\'s a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . \\nanyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin . \\nnow although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown . \\nsure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive . \\nthe whole film is like this , and it\\'s basically nothing but a headache . \\non the brighter side , tim robbin\\'s direction was masterful . \\nhis camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson\\'s latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can\\'t make a movie that much better . \\nalthough it has it\\'s moments ( not many of them , but they\\'re there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it\\'s title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over . \\n',\n",

       " \"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . \\ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . \\nand when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . \\nthe film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . \\ni particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . \\ni also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . \\nat this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . \\nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . \\nhowever , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . \\noff the high board . \\nsuddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . \\nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . \\nif he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . \\nbut now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . \\nindeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . \\nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . \\nwhile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . \\nand the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . \\nat this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' \\nthen i realized he was , and i was watching it . \\nin the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . \\nnote : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . \\nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . \\nher refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . \\ni found this scene offensive . \\nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . \\ni think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . \\nlate in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . \\nthis could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! \\n`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . \\na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . \\nin this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . \\nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . \\ninstead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . \\ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\n\",\n",

       " 'back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention , new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi tv show lost in space , complete with in-person appearances by cast members mimi rogers , matt leblanc , lacey chabert , jack johnson , and even gary oldman . \\nthat should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle . . . \\nlast action hero . \\nbut no , like millions of others , i bought into the hype and \" got lost . \" \\nif only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe . \\nyou may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film . \\nat the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i\\'d hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in . \\nto say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not . \\nafter the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script\\'s \" stream \" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting . \\nthey encounter another ship . \\nthey board it . \\nalien spiders attack them . \\nthey return to their ship . \\nthe other one explodes . \\nthey land on a deserted planet . \\nand so on . \\nan attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act , but goldsman doesn\\'t seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character\\'s past self dies , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on . \\nthe look and effects should be lost in space\\'s ace-in-the-hole , but hopkins even manages to botch that . \\nfor a big-budget film , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy . \\nin one composite background shot , i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like . . . \\ndigital effects . \\nbut nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp , a monkey-like space creature that becomes penny\\'s pet . \\nentirely computer-generated and every inch showing it , blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game . \\napparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp\\'s composite shots with the human actors ? \\nbut in doing so , the seams are that much more obvious . \\nyou have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy . \\nnew line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount . \\ni don\\'t think so . \\nin a few years , the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question : what film ended titanic\\'s 15-week reign at the top of the weekend box office ? \\n',\n",

\\nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it\\'ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise\\'s firing gun just so they can die really cool . \\nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \\nin one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other\\'s eyes with come hither sexuality ?

       " 'by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . \\nafter all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . \\nthe first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . \\nas olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects . \\nlane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination . \\nall the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other\\'s protagonist . \\nbut then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse . \\nlacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years . \\nhe\\'s not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they\\'ve got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . \\ntwo months earlier , lacrosse\\'s own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . \\nlacrosse knows his killer\\'s work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . \\nit wouldn\\'t be fair to reduce everything that\\'s wrong with switchback to quaid\\'s presence , but it\\'s a pretty good place to start . \\nthere\\'s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . \\nwe can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he\\'s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . \\na more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . \\nquaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . \\nit\\'s tough to become emotionally invested in a character\\'s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . \\neven without quaid , it doesn\\'t appear that switchback would have stayed on course . \\nthe early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . \\nunfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . \\nonce the mystery of the killer\\'s identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . \\nin fact , \" stale and predictable \" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents . \\nit\\'s too bad stuart wasn\\'t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . \\nplayed with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he\\'s a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions . \\na film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . \\ninstead , stuart places his trust in a \" name \" star who can\\'t carry the material . \\nmaybe next time he\\'ll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story . \\n',\n",

\" \\nanymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . \\nthis picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . \\nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . \\nhorror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . \\nthere are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . \\ni also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . \\nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . \\nthe acting is largely a waste of talent . \\nmarsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . \\nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . \\nstahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn\\'t good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl\\'s performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . \\nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn\\'t all that cool . \\ndisturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . \\ni\\'m surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . \\nit\\'s not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it\\'s an uninspired lump of a film . \\nit sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . \\nso , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \\n',\n",

\\nwell , this wouldn\\'t be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie . \\nhere\\'s why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of \" 8mm \" . . . \\nfirst thing--if you don\\'t heed my advice , then understand what you\\'re about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud . \\nit\\'s not easy to watch . \\ni didn\\'t know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now . \\nthe ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator . \\na rich old woman discovers a \" snuff \" film in her late husband\\'s safe . \\nshe calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn\\'t it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead . \\nshe\\'s horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find . \\nfamily-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque \" murder \" . \\nlet me backtrack for a moment . \\nsee , \" snuff \" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead . \\nhowever , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and \" good \" acting make all the difference . \\nvery sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies . \\nthe thought of this \" industry \" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i\\'ll swallow my bile and move on . \\nwelles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry . \\nyou\\'d think he\\'s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! \\nhe comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze . \\nafter a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , \" snuff \" films . \\nskip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . . \\nled by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer \" machine \" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante . \\nthis film doesn\\'t draw you in . \\nit keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? \\nit is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . \\n \" se7en \" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . \\nby those jabs , i\\'m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the \" batman \" franchise , but \" a time to kill \" was an immensely overrated disappointment . \\nfor a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled . \\na good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter . \\nwriter andrew kevin walker didn\\'t recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for \\'95s twisted thriller , \" se7en \" . \\ndirector schumacher doesn\\'t have that innate ability to make you watch things you don\\'t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing . \\nhe must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don\\'t see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it\\'s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) . \\nhowever , gratuitous is joel\\'s middle name . \\nhe must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint . \\nno , he doesn\\'t go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness . \\nhe doesn\\'t leave much to the imagination . \\nit\\'s manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . \\nthe script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) \\ncraft . \\ncase in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) \\ndrives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) . \\nsee . . . no \\nsubtlety . \\ndoes joel think we\\'re stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? \\nwho do we root for in this mess ? \\nis there anybody out there ? \\nit\\'s not all the director\\'s fault , though . \\nwhy did the actors sign up for this ? \\nnicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin\\' out loud ! \\nif he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? \\nwhat is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? \\nvillainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy . \\nand what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? \\nhe was so solid as a concerned father in \" a civil action \" . \\ni guess ol\\' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or \\nthey\\'re suckers . \\nor they just don\\'t care . \\nthere are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland . \\ncatherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells . \\nbaby cindy is obviously cute and wells\\' devout love of his daughter is sweet . \\nthe mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter . \\nthis film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like \" payback \" ( which was a much better movie ) . \\nthe editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it\\'s rough . \\nduring some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren\\'t good and whose timing was a half-second off . \\nsuch a technical error indeed stands out . \\nspeaking of standing out , don\\'t believe the misleading trailers . \\nthere\\'s not much action here . \\noccasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe . \\nafter seeing \" 8mm \" , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again . \\nis that a positive ? \\nwell , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they\\'ve done a swell job here . \\nit\\'ll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved . \\nbut today i\\'m not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ? \\ni\\'m sure that somewhere right now there\\'s some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn\\'t mean i need to know about it . \\nyes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there . \\nyes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn\\'t look like we expect him to . \\nyou said all that in 1995 . \\nmove on . \\nthis film serves no purpose . \\nit doesn\\'t entertain , it doesn\\'t teach us anything , it doesn\\'t make a statement beyond the obvious \" this stuff is bad \" approach . \\nonly if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile . \\nthat\\'s not likely to happen , though , so \" 8mm \" is indeed a scummy waste of money . \\norson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , \" to movies . . . to \\ngood movies \" . \\nif only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole . \\nlike \" snuff \" films , \" 8mm \" should never have been made . \\nnow , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it . \\nuseless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme . \\nhe used it in \" batman forever \" , in \" batman & robin \" , in \" a time to kill \" , in \" falling down \" , and it\\'s rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . . \\n',\n",

       " 'i\\'ll be the first to admit it . \\nwhen you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch . \\nyes , it\\'s a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine . \\ncertainly , the experience wasn\\'t truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , \" i\\'m not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i\\'ll \\ngonna tell it the way i remember it . \" \\nanyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it\\'s trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations . \\ninstead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) . \\nfinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) . \\nthe setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s . \\nfinn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) . \\nduring one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) . \\nborrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro\\'s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor . \\nok . . . maybe \\nthat\\'s an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini\\'s records in the opening scenes of the film . \\nand that\\'s nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn\\'s motorboat , but i digress . \\nanyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he\\'s a really swell guy . \\nand then the plot moves on . \\nenter miss havisham . . . or \\nms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) . \\nabandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid . \\nwith bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role . \\nalthough she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film . \\njoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) . \\nfor no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella . \\nperhaps it\\'s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before . \\nin any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn\\'t exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her . \\neven when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there\\'s nothing . \\nin fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear\\'s gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets . \\nat this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella\\'s character , and couldn\\'t care less about the two characters . \\nthe bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow . \\nshe fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity . \\nthere\\'s obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you\\'re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character . \\nwithout a strong estella , finn\\'s obsession seems baseless . \\nyou wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life . \\nin fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot . \\nfinn\\'s relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical . \\nwhat\\'s more fascinating are his interactions with deniro . \\nalthough it\\'s only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create . \\nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film . \\nsome of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact . \\nfinn\\'s art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect . \\nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful . \\nas a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film . \\nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare\\'s romeo+juliet ) . \\nsimply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock . \\nbut such adornments do little to perk up great expectations . \\nas much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you\\'d probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film . \\n',\n",

s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise . \\nthe film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . \\nit unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother\\'s old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . \\nboth women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . \\ntheir circumstances ( and those of jia-li\\'s brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . \\nit is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn\\'t . \\nthe problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . \\nfor a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . \\nthe film\\'s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . \\nseen now , it does not seem provocative . \\nindeed , it\\'s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . \\nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . \\nnor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material . \\nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple\\'s first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband\\'s mistress--but they are brief . \\ntoo often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . \\nperhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . \\nbut jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . \\nat two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded . \\nconsider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach . \\nthe thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . \\neven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . \\nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . \\nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative . \\nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it\\'s his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world\\'s leading cinematographers . \\nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . \\nyou would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle\\'s inexperience or yang\\'s humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . \\nin scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak . \\n',\n",

\\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n",

       " 'i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . \\nit\\'s not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . \\ni sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . \\nin a word , it\\'s the same thing that\\'s wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . \\nmore to the point , it\\'s the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you\\'re telling a story about a relationship . \\nthe bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we\\'re expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they\\'re attractive and pleasant . \\nin this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o\\'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . \\nit\\'s a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . \\nconvinced despite his reservations that it\\'s time to \" sh * t or get off the pot , \" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . \\nanne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . \\njimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . \\nthere are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy\\'s 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends . \\nit\\'s a wacky , brewster\\'s millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film\\'s better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . \\nat least that would be the case if jimmy weren\\'t already a world-class altruist . \\nscreenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn\\'t get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . \\nfrom the outset , jimmy\\'s motivation isn\\'t cash ; it\\'s the livelihoods of his devoted employees . \\nit\\'s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor\\'s plot development . \\nby any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . \\nand that\\'s the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . \\nthere\\'s never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there\\'s no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . \\nthe blandly nice o\\'donnell couldn\\'t pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don\\'t even let him ; zellweger\\'s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . \\nand forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . \\nthe parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they\\'re all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . \\ni\\'ll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov\\'s rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . \\nfar more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . \\nyou\\'re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that\\'s not the real problem . \\nnor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it\\'s leading up to . \\nthe problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there\\'s no spark , no energy , no humanity . \\nit\\'s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer\\'s digestions . \\nwe\\'ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don\\'t even have a pulse . \\nthe bachelor is love among the mannequins . \\n',\n",

\\nother than director russ meyer\\'s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . \\nthat is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \\nafter watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \\nthis movie stinks out loud . \\nquite frankly , this movie deserves a . \\nbut there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . \\nso i\\'m giving it a . \\nand maybe that is too generous . \\nright from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . \\nnot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . \\ni had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \\nto be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \\nwith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn\\'t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \\nso what is this movie about ?

       " 'any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . \\nfrankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director\\'s greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . \\nunfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be \\'90s thriller . \\nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . \\nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what\\'s going on so that these flaws in logic don\\'t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . \\nunfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they\\'re happening . \\nthis is a very bad sign . \\nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . \\nof course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . \\na perfect murder isn\\'t a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott\\'s play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock\\'s version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . \\nemily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . \\ntheir marriage isn\\'t going well -- emily resents steven\\'s controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . \\nwhen steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn\\'t that of a typical cuckolded husband . \\ninstead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that\\'s too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven\\'s new york apartment and kill emily . \\n ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he\\'s supposed to get the rest . ) \\nultimately , i\\'m not sure which of the three main characters we\\'re supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . \\nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they\\'re not interesting . \\n ( it\\'s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn\\'t . ) \\nsteven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . \\nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . \\nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he\\'s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . \\ngwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . \\nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998\\'s worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . \\nat least viggo mortensen ( g . i . \\njane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . \\nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of \" poirot , \" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily\\'s best friend . \\na perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . \\nthere aren\\'t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . \\nit\\'s surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . \\nit\\'s just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . \\n',\n",

       " ' \" america\\'s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn\\'t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \\nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \\ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \\n \" america\\'s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \\nit\\'s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \\nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \\njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \\nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . \\nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen\\'s solo films have tanked . \\nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber\\'s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \\ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \\nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \\nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen\\'s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \\nwhat lee doesn\\'t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \\npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \\nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \\ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \\nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \\nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \\nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \\nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \\nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \\nthe \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \\nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \\nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \\nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \\nwhen they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de-clawed . \\ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \\nlee certainly isn\\'t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \\nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \\nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \\nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn\\'t matter because any publicity is good publicity . \\nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \\nso what about the cast ? \\njulia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . \\ncatherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . \\nby casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . \\nin supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" \\nseth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . \\ncome to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . \\nas a hollywood satire , \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is toothless . \\nas a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . \\nsuch a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . \\nhad it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \" \\n',\n",

) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris\\' goddaughter . \\nso , when paris finds out she\\'s been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . \\nnot knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . \\nof course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . \\nalong the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by \" jurassic park , \" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she\\'s barely pushing fifteen ) . \\nwhat the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . \\nnot to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of \" king kong lives , \" which is two weeks overdue . \\nthis mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( \" face/off \" ) , who also served as executive producer . \\nwoo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . \\nwong , who directed such films as \" rock\\'n\\'roll cop \" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . \\nmaybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they\\'re not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . \\nmany of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . \\nin addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey\\'s script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue . \\nwhat he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is \" it\\'s all love \" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco\\'s stuttering , black-wannabe assistant . \\nthe irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole . \\n',\n",

&nbsp ; \\nno . &nbsp ; the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter\\'s talents and the relationship between cinema and television . \\n&nbsp ; first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched . &nbsp ; \\nafter approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail\\'s crawl . &nbsp ; \\nnot long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not . &nbsp ; \\nthe explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much . &nbsp ; \\ni am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much . &nbsp ; \\nbreaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too . \\n&nbsp ; the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal . &nbsp ; \\nthe extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day . &nbsp ; \\nnote that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think . \\n&nbsp ; the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running . &nbsp ; \\nin comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge . \\n&nbsp ; the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people . &nbsp ; \\nhowever , i rather liked that about the series . &nbsp ; \\ntelevision allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want . &nbsp ; \\nit is the proverbial \" blank screen \" which we project our minds on . &nbsp ; \\nmeaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium . \\n&nbsp ; cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite . &nbsp ; \\nit projects onto us the filmmakers mind . &nbsp ; \\nwe can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film . &nbsp ; \\nmeaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined . \\n&nbsp ; so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well . &nbsp ; \\nhe did not . &nbsp ; \\nby making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill . \\n&nbsp ; when they say that \" fans \" make a tv show , it is not far from the truth . &nbsp ; \\non television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there . &nbsp ; \\nhow true that is when we see the \" explicit \" x-files - there is nothing there . \\n',\n",

       " \"several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . \\nthis is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio . \\nthere's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . \\nthe premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest . \\nedwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries . \\nalong the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair . \\nthe explorers' trek takes them through forests , across the snow-capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall . \\nthis setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . \\nfarley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn't seem to be in it . \\nmatthew perry , one of the stars of tv's friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast . \\nas a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . \\ni'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . \\nas far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression . \\neugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . \\nfrankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . \\nalthough guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . \\nthe special effects , such as they are , are execrable . \\nfor an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . \\neven though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . \\nwhile some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . \\nfarley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session . \\n\",\n",

       " 'the following review encompasses two versions of dune : \\ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \\nthe film\\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \\ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \\nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \\nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \\n * * * the review * * * \\nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \\ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \\nthe screenplay was lynch\\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \\ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \\nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \\nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \\nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \\nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \\nlynch\\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\\'s two main strands . \\none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \\nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \\nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \\nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \\nthe thinking among universal\\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \\nwith lynch\\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \\nwhat a great idea ! \\nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \\nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \\nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \\nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\\'t care much for them . \\nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \\ndune is also a very serous film . \\nthe constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \\nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \\nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \\nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\\' star wars trilogy . \\nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \\nit still possesses enough of lynch\\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \\nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \\nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \\nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \\nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \\nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \\nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \\nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \\nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \\nthe conclusion ? \\nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \\ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \\ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \\nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \\nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \\nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director\\'s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \\nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \\nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \\nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \\nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \\ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\\'s handiwork there\\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \\nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \\nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\\'s storyline . \\npaul\\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \\nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \\npaul\\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \\nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \\nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \\nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \\nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \\nthere\\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \\nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \\nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \\nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \\nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \\nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\\'t even in herbert\\'s book . \\nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \\nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \\ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \\nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \\nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \\non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \\nstill , as one of this century\\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \\nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\n',\n",
       " \"in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism . \\nwhich wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . \\nin such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany . \\nof course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons . \\nfor them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era . \\nwhich , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience . \\none of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn . \\nsalon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 . \\nin 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats . \\nnone of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged . \\nthe most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise . \\nscreenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names . \\nschellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top . \\nkitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer . \\ncaught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel . \\nthere she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe . \\nwhen margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged . \\nshe informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg . \\nthose who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation . \\nbut , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . \\nunfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti's the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin's unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli's musical numbers from cabaret . \\nall in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments . \\n\",\n",

       " 'the general\\'s daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . \\ndirector simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . \\nwhat\\'s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . \\njohn travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . \\nbrenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth\\'s mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . \\nsoon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . \\nebert\\'s law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . \\nperhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it\\'s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . \\non a story level , the general\\'s daughter is ineptly constructed . \\nthe film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille\\'s novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and \" shocking \" plot developments . \\nhaving not read the novel , it\\'s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . \\nscene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . \\n ( sunderland actually asks brenner , \" why was she killed ? \" \\nto which i would have answered , \" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . \" ) \\nonly after we\\'ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . \\nnot that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . \\nin one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . \\nshe sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . \\ninstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner\\'s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . \\nthis scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it\\'s gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film\\'s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . \\nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . \\ni realized that these constructs on screen aren\\'t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . \\nthis would have been bad enough without the west\\'s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . \\ncompelling films about sexual crimes don\\'t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don\\'t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . \\nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they\\'re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . \\nin addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it\\'s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . \\nthis standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . \\nas it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . \\nperhaps the only positive elements in the general\\'s daughter are a couple of the performances . \\njames woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . \\ni also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . \\nnonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . \\nthe general\\'s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments . \\n',\n",

       " 'weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg\\'s reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \\nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \\nspielberg\\'s greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \\nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \\nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \\n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a \" pr mission \" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \\nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \\nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \\nthere\\'s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \\nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \\nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \\nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg\\'s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \\nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \\nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \\nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \\nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \\nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \\nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \\nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \\nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there\\'s an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \\nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \\nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \\nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \\nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \\nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \" \\nanother aspect of the \" hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \\nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell\\'s superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \\n \" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? \" \\nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \\nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as \" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? \" \\nor some variant thereof . \\nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" f \" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \\nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an \" r \" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \\nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \\nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \\nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \\nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \\nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \\nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \\nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \\n . \\n',\n",
       " 'if you\\'re going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? \\nif you\\'re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? \\nwhile watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . \\nwhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . \\ncelebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he\\'s familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . \\nallen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . \\nbranagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . \\nthe usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . \\nunless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it\\'s not likely that you\\'ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . \\naside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . \\nbranagh proves once again that he\\'s a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . \\nthe problem is that he\\'s the same character allen always plays , a character who\\'s getting more than a little dull to watch . \\ni mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? \\n-- he hates his work , and he can\\'t be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . \\nhe brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he\\'s receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it\\'s pretty hard to care about him . \\nin addition , isn\\'t allen capable of creating characters who aren\\'t just like him ? \\ni know he is , but he didn\\'t do it in celebrity . \\nthe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . \\ndavis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . \\nsome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they\\'re not likable people . \\nonly famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon\\'s new novel , has any life . \\nthe men in the picture don\\'t do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . \\nwhat\\'s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its \" themes \" are . \\nallen seems to think that he\\'s making an insightful movie about the way \" normal \" people look at celebrities . \\nthe main problem with this is that the character with whom we\\'re supposed to identify , simon , is not a \" normal \" guy -- he\\'s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . \\nthe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . \\nin addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , \" it\\'s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! \" ) . \\ncelebrity is arguably allen\\'s biggest misfire to date . \\nit does have a few good scenes -- theron\\'s super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . \\nbut celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen\\'s point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . \\nif he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . \\ni , for one , don\\'t enjoy feeling like an outsider . \\n',\n",

       " 'remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \\n \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \\nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be\\'s but upon closer inspection doesn\\'t look like anything comprehendable . \\nit\\'s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won\\'t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \\ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who\\'s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \\nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \\nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it\\'s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" \\nwith \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \\nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren\\'t hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \\nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \\nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \\nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he\\'s doing ) . \\nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can\\'t call the authorities for help . \\nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers\\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \\nthe exec\\'s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \\nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \\nmcquarrie doesn\\'t know the meaning of the word simple . \\nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \\neverything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it\\'s to the point of surrealism . \\nnothing is what it seems in this reality , it\\'s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry\\'s rules and regulations . \\nevery scene with caan\\'s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we\\'re hardly given a clue as to what they\\'re talking about . \\nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they\\'re more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet\\'s trash . \\nno one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \\nit\\'s like a dream without any appeal . \\ntake the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \\nthey sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don\\'t move . \\nthe guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \\nyou\\'d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \\nthere\\'s a lot of things i didn\\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \\nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \\nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\\'s army . \\nif they were suicidal they wouldn\\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \\nthere\\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \\nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \\nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \\nand it\\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \\nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \\ni can\\'t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can\\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \\n',\n",

       " 'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nit\\'s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor\\'s first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup . \\nany hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film\\'s latter half . \\nthe film\\'s central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill . \\nnick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide . \\nnick casually asks for terry\\'s wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills . \\nof course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch . \\nlearning of nick\\'s condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry\\'s compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick\\'s lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry\\'s death wish by killing him . \\nthis is a promising premise , and mr . taylor\\'s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character . \\nthis is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux . \\nhowever , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable . \\nunfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film\\'s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits . \\nfar from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond . \\nmr . taylor\\'s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as \" you should have asked something more interesting , like \\'do you enjoy the pain ? \\' \\n- see , that\\'s provocative , leaves room for further questions . \" ) \\nthe film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick\\'s acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . \\nthis occurs particularly often during the film\\'s opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i\\'m realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it\\'s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick\\'s scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . \\nthe entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . \\namong the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang\\'s swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . \\nmr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . \\nthe charge of dream with the fishes\\'s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters . \\nfor dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die . \\n',\n",

\\ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . \\nschwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . \\narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . \\nin other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . \\nharrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they\\'ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . \\nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho\\'s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine\\'s location by offering him his old life back . \\nnone of these scenes really work , because arnie isn\\'t up to the task . \\nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . \\nthis one isn\\'t at all believable the way arnold plays him . \\nthe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . \\nas the prince of darkness , he\\'s suave and confident . \\nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act . \\nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . \\nbyrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . \\nbyrne\\'s speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold\\'s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" \\'tis not ! \" \\nvariety ) are feeble at best . \\nthe only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . \\nkevin pollack plays jericho\\'s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . \\nrobin tunney isn\\'t given much to do except look scared . \\nin fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . \\nperformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . \\nthis being an action blockbuster , it\\'s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it\\'s utterly ridiculous . \\nwhy is the devil coming on new year\\'s eve , 1999 ? \\nbecause it\\'s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn\\'t 666 , it turns out . \\nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you\\'ve got 1999 ! \\nif you don\\'t buy this explanation , you\\'re not alone . \\nit\\'s convoluted and silly at the same time . \\nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she\\'s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . \\n . \\n . ) , and if that weren\\'t bad enough , there\\'s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn\\'t explained at all . \\nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he\\'s powerless ? \\nis he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? \\nhow come he can\\'t control jericho or christine ? \\nand how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? \\na clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it\\'s never actually explained . \\nusually , this sort of thing wouldn\\'t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don\\'t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . \\nthere are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in \" end of days , \" complete with the old \" black cat hiding in a cabinet \" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . \\nit gets so formulaic that it\\'s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a \" boo \" will come . \\ntheir predictions will rarely be wrong . \\nthe more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don\\'t care about these characters ( due to the script\\'s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don\\'t make any sense . \\nthere\\'s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . \\nit\\'s good for a few chuckles , but not much else . \\nsupposedly we\\'re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . \\nnone of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it\\'s often hard to tell why it\\'s happening in the first place , not to mention that they\\'re edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . \\nmost of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , \" wow , cool ! \" \\n \" end of days \" is not only silly and confusing , but it\\'s also distinctly unpleasant to watch . \\nthe devil apparently doesn\\'t operate in the more subtle , i\\'ll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . \\nthis doesn\\'t only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in \" end of days \" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . \\nif violence is supposed to be shocking , it\\'s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . \\nscenes aren\\'t connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . \\nreasons ? \\nto hell with reasons ! \\nlet\\'s just blow stuff up ! \\nisn\\'t it cool ? \\nnope , not by a long shot . \\nthis film is thoroughly unwatchable . \\nit\\'s dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . \\nperhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it\\'s not happening with hack peter hyams here . \\n \" end of days \" might have had camp value , if only it didn\\'t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody\\'s going to buy . \\nif the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . \\nif it\\'s going to be campy , arnold shouldn\\'t be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn\\'t actually see him put up on a cross , did i ?

\\nabsolutely none . \\nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \\nthen we have the actors . \\nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \\nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \\ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \\nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \\nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \\ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \\nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \\nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \\nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \\nfortunately that is something she does very well . \\nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \\nit\\'s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \\nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \\nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\\'s horror movies , the blair witch project . \\nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \\nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \\nif the story sucks , it\\'s all downhill from there . \\nmy advice ?

\\ntoo much . \\nseagal\\'s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . \\nnot for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . \\nno kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . \\nthat\\'s really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . \\nwe trusted him . \\nwe got to know him . \\nnow , betrayal . \\ni don\\'t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he\\'s going to try to be funny again . \\ni\\'ll try , but it won\\'t be easy . \\nif you haven\\'t watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . \\nit\\'s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . \\nafter all , if we can\\'t depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?

\\nwrong . it\\'s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . \\ni must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the \" wacky \" goings-on . \\nspice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . \\nwhile a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a \" dance bootcamp \" scene , the girls sing the lyric \" we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra \" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . \\nsome gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore\\'s recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . \\nthe only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . \\nha ha . \\nas weak as the script is , i think there\\'s one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . \\nthe point is not that they can\\'t act ( and , for the record , they really _can\\'t_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . \\nposh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . \\nbaby\\'s persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls\\' identities are a little harder to flesh out . \\nthere really isn\\'t much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being \" ginger \" or \" scary \" ? \\napparently , just their wardrobes . \\nspice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices\\' signature hit , \" wannabe . \" \\nthe song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters\\' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman\\'s the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . \\nthis section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . \\nspice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . \\nbut this sloppy enterprise surely won\\'t win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . \\nonce the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices\\' final hurrah in america . \\n',\n",

\\nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson\\'s book , and there are some priceless comic observations . \\nbut you\\'re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . \\nthis brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . \\ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson\\'s dialogue . \\nin between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . \\nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . \\nit\\'s interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . \\nas much of a fan as i am of gilliam\\'s work , cox would have been the better choice . \\nsid and nancy , cox\\'s best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . \\ngilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . \\nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? \\nit doesn\\'t try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn\\'t work as broad comedy . \\nif he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . \\nbut i don\\'t want to be too hard on it . \\nthere are some truly funny moments , and if you\\'re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . \\ni do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . \\n',\n",

       " 'one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet\\'s \" gloria , \" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . \\nsuddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . \\nwhen a movie is over , aren\\'t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? \\ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn\\'t have been anything to talk about in the first place . \\nto be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy\\'s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \\nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \\neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \\nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn\\'t commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \\nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \\ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don\\'t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \\nthe previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can\\'t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \\nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn\\'t completely unbearable to watch . \\ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \\nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \\nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" \\nas gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn\\'t sound realistic at all . \\nin the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone\\'s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \\nalthough not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \\njean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \\nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria\\'s friend whom she turns to for help . \\nsony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don\\'t blame them . \\nthey declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \\nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \\nalthough stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995\\'s \" casino \" or 1996\\'s \" last dance \" if you don\\'t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \\n',\n",

? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . \\nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . \\nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . \\nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can\\'t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80\\'s next to wall street . \\nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . \\npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . \\nit was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . \\nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . \\nhe gave them heart . \\ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . \\nhe preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . \\nthis is not the way to get any message across . \\nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin\\' skins ?

\\nhow could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? \\nissues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn\\'t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought . \\nalso , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes . \\nand when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children . \\nyou can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . \\nyou think to yourself : \" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , \" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . \\nmeg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998\\'s \" hurlyburly \" or 1994\\'s \" when a man loves a woman \" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies . \\nwith \" hanging up , \" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn\\'t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle . \\neven if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son\\'s birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . \\ndiane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . \\nwhat is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan\\'s senior . \\nyeah , right . \\nlastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999\\'s \" analyze this . \" \\nkudrow isn\\'t given enough time to create a full personality with maddy , so it isn\\'t her fault she doesn\\'t register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue . \\nif anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar-caliber work in 1998\\'s \" the opposite of sex . \" \\nif you are a fan of kudrow\\'s ( and who isn\\'t ?

       " 'a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . \\nfamily breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . \\nstill , i can\\'t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . \\nand after it , i still can\\'t . \\nbye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . \\nonly a few moments which have nothing to do with the film\\'s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . \\nbye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . \\ndave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . \\nover the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic\\'s blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny\\'s growing estrangement from emma . \\nthe three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . \\nrandy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . \\nhis run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . \\nhe does get bye bye love\\'s best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . \\npaul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy \" mad about you \" persona , but he does it well . \\nas a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . \\nmatthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . \\nthis isn\\'t a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . \\nmodine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it\\'s all his father\\'s fault he\\'s such a cad . \\ncarolco\\'s executives , whose entire future is resting on modine\\'s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . \\nbye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another \" dating in the 90s \" movie . \\nwhen the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . \\neven more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald\\'s and befriends a troubled youth . \\nit is a sad end to flanders\\' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald\\'s as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . \\neven if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . \\nany way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . \\nit is left to the dads\\' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn\\'t enough . \\nthere have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . \\nbye bye love is a genuine shame . \\n',\n",

the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . \\nhe is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . \\nbridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women

one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . \\nwisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . \\npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been

production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . \\nhowever , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . \\ninstead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . \\nfirst , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . \\nat other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . \\nthere are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . \\nnot in a single one of them does anybody pay the

just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . \\nbut it didn't happen that way . \\nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line

\\nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \\nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \\nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa\\'s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \\nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \\nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \\nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \\nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) . \\nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \\nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \\nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn\\'t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \\ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \\nof course , one can\\'t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \\nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \\nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \\nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it\\'s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? \\nstrictly speaking , \" tarzan and the lost city \" isn\\'t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien\\'s laughably stiff performance comes real close . \\nthis movie proves what \" starship troopers \" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . \\nvan dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he\\'s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . \\ni also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . \\nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he\\'s like a charmless version of belloq from \" raiders of the lost ark . \" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . \\nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . \\nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city \" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . \\nso , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . \\n',\n",

       " \"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . \\nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . \\nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . \\nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . \\nthis time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . \\nby all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . \\none is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \\ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \\nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \\nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \\nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \\ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \\nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \\nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \\nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \\nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \\nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \\nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \\nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \\neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \\nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \\nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \\nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \\ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \\nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \\nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \\n\",\n",

\\nbecause in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) \\nthe fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . \\nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . \\nkim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . \\npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it\\'s never explained . \\nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised . \\nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr\\'s house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night\\'s events . \\nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . \\nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . \\nsexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . \\nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . \\nthe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen\\'s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . \\nthe videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , \" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! \" \\nooh . \\nspooky . \\nthe team goes back to jeffrey\\'s house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . \\nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . \\nwacky hijinks ensue . \\ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . \\nthroughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about \" reverse , \" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . \\nwhen they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . \\n ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . \\nokay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , \\nnevermind . ) \\nthis movie was awful . \\nsimply awful . \\nthe characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . \\nerica is the nature-loving wiccan . \\ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . \\nsteven is the overbearing asshole . \\nkim is the antisocial goth girl . \\nold , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . \\nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ?

its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \\nand with good reason . \\nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \\nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \\n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \\numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \\nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \\nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \\nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \\nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \\nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \\nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \\n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \\noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \\nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \\nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \\nat least it all looks good . \\nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \\nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \\nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \\nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \\nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \\nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \\na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \\nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \\n\",\n",

\\nwell , i imagine he didn\\'t have one . \\nthat\\'s why he feels like a plot device . \\nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he\\'s recently retired from film ( i don\\'t blame him , honestly ) . \\nobi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . \\nmcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . \\nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . \\nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . \\ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . \\nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . \\nalso fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . \\njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i\\'ve ever had to endure , but he\\'s more interesting than most of the humans . \\nas soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it\\'s back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . \\ni\\'ve seen many movies that qualify as \" special effects extravaganzas , \" but the phantom menace is the first one i\\'ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . \\nthe reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . \\ni can\\'t say that i didn\\'t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . \\nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . \\nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . \\ncan\\'t we have one stinking scene that isn\\'t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? \\ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . \\nand then there\\'s the question of magic . \\nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? \\ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . \\njohn williams\\' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas\\' direction . \\ni think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . \\ni longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . \\nand what about the ridiculous expectations ?

spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it\\'s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . \\nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . \\nthe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . \\nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . \\nexcept for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . \\nas for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . \\nm : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . \\nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . \\nthe only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film\\'s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . \\nit\\'s a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . \\nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . \\njohn woo ( \" broken arrow \" / \" face/off \" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can\\'t seem to handle dialogue and suspense . \\nthe star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . \\ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . \\ntheir romance didn\\'t work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn\\'t convincing . \\nthe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . \\nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . \\nfirst , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \\nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \\nwhich explains the film\\'s mythic theme . . . as \\nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \\nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \\nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \\nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \\nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \\nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \\nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \\nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \\nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \\nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \\nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \\nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \\nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \\nhopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . \\nactually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . \\nin seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \\nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \\nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \\nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first \" mission , \" who is noted for doing \" chinatown \" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \\nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \\nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \\nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean\\'s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \\nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick\\'s everyone\\'s ass . \\nif i was only entertained by this . . . i \\ncould have lived with it . \\nbut this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . \\nin any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial

       " 'ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . \\nthe review \\njean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says \" been there , done that . \" \\nno film critic could possibly sum up van damme\\'s recent film choices any better . \\nwhile other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . \\nthis unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . \\nhe joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . \\nuniversal soldier : the return is truly poor . \\nthe plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . \\nsoldier\\'s kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger\\'s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . \\nconsidering the poor box office performance of soldier , it\\'s amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead . \\nluc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . \\nin this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program . \\nworking with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth . \\nunfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . \\nthe rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . \\nthere are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . \\nthere are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . \\nluc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . \\nerin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she \" isn\\'t leaving without her story \" . \\nwhatever . \\nother laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . \\nnot one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . \\nwhen fuelled by don davis\\' loud , driving music score , the film\\'s many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol\\' jean-claude moves . \\ndirector mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . \\nhis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . \\nif only jean-claude weren\\'t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . \\nto place the blame squarely at van damme\\'s feet , however , is an injustice . \\ni\\'m not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano\\'s script sound good . \\none particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . \\nhe cringes , looks down and mutters \" uh . . . uhm . . . \\nthey all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . \\neh he he he \" the script\\'s and indeed the entire film\\'s only saving grace is goldberg . \\nhe chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . \\nhe even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like \" i really don\\'t like that guy \" every time he fails to kill luc . \\nsadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video . \\n',\n",

malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \\nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \\nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \\ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \\nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \\ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \\nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \\nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \\nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \\nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\n\",\n",

\\napparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called \" mercury . \" \\nto make sure it can\\'t be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a \" nerds\\' puzzle magazine . \" \\nof course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . \\nwhen he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . \\nas a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . \\nbut he hasn\\'t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . \\nit\\'s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn\\'t do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . \\nfor those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren\\'t that pulse-pounding . \\nthe climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . \\noverall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn\\'t derivative or obligatory . \\nbruce willis\\' star seems to be fading . \\nthis is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . \\nwillis isn\\'t terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . \\nalec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . \\nthe film\\'s real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp\\'s son in wes craven\\'s new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . \\nmercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . \\nfor those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . \\nhopefully , the advent of summer will change that . \\nuntil then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . \\nand , if you\\'re determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may . \\n',\n",

) \\nworst of all , godzilla isn\\'t even exciting . \\nwith the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn\\'t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . \\neven the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . \\nindependence day may have been dumb , but it was full of \" adrenaline moments \" capable of getting the audience involved in the action . \\nin this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . \\nactually , part of the problem is that we\\'re never sure who we\\'re supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . \\nthe plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . \\nafter sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . \\nhe does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . \\nin the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . \\non hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . \\nin his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . \\nin nick\\'s words , godzilla is \" a mutated aberration ?

       " 'while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling\\'s true genius as a film-maker is casting . \\nin fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn\\'s jeff spicoli ; in look who\\'s talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . \\nshe seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . \\nunfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands . \\ngiving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . \\ngiving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . \\nnaturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . \\npaul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city . \\npaul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul . \\npaul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . \\ndora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that\\'s more than slightly one-sided . \\nthey\\'re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser . \\ni must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling\\'s casting . \\njason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . \\nthey\\'re pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren\\'t . \\nthen it gradually becomes clear that there\\'s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . \\nin theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . \\ninstead of taking any time to make the characters\\' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters\\' situations pathetic . \\nshe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film\\'s interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless\\'s plot came via jane austen\\'s emma ) . \\nshe simply turns the film into a pity party . \\nsince loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . \\ninstead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there\\'s no reason to watch them . \\npaul isn\\'t just a nice guy , he\\'s flawless ; consequently , he\\'s a central character who does absolutely no growing . \\nhis roommates aren\\'t just inconsiderate , they\\'re actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . \\nand professor alcott isn\\'t just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . \\ndora\\'s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn\\'t explored in sufficient detail . \\nthere\\'s more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming\\'s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it\\'s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it\\'s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . \\nand it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . \\ni don\\'t know . . . \\ncomic . \\nstill , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . \\nthat hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel\\'s \" scarborough fair/canticle . \" \\ninstead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . \\neven in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist\\'s foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint . \\nclueless\\'s cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . \\nin loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul\\'s dorm \" hunt\\'s hall \" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) . \\nher gift with casting proved to be her curse . \\nloser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren\\'t those two kids swell ? \\n',\n",

its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling . \\nit\\'s no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor . \\n \" i , the jury \" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn\\'t do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made . \\nthe script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like \" it\\'s alive \" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , \" q \" ( 1981 ) , and \" the stuff \" ( 1985 ) . \\ncohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director\\'s chair after only a week\\'s worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget . \\nhe was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects . \\nheffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . \\nit shows in the final product . \\ncohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none . \\nhe shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull . \\nthe movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron\\'s background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , \" i , the jury , \" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth . \\nbut the problems in \" i , the jury \" run deeper than the technical . \\nthe central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties . \\nbecause spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer\\'s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona . \\nwe never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don\\'t have hammer in them at all . \\nconsequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane\\'s storytelling is lost . \\nthe period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer\\'s moral code is thrown to the wind . \\ndespite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code . \\nthe title itself , \" i , the jury , \" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law . \\nunlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment . \\nin this way , he can be seen as \" above the law , \" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality . \\nthe movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society\\'s terms , but in any terms , especially his own . \\nif anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful . \\nmaybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer\\'s character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie . \\nthe blame for hammer\\'s character can\\'t be laid on assante\\'s shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance . \\nspillane never once described hammer\\'s physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him . \\nof course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane\\'s books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963\\'s \" the girl hunters , \" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) . \\nthe rest of actors are most un-noteworthy . \\nwith the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in \" i , the jury \" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere . \\nmany of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on \" dallas \" in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film . \\nmaybe someday , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book , but this is certainly not it . \\n',\n",

this seems enough to illustrate my point . \\nthis movie is really stupid . \\nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \\nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t just suggest this message ;

she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \\nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \\nthe face-painting that\\'s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \\nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \\nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \\nadd to this the film\\'s faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you\\'d expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it\\'s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i\\'ve seen in quite a while . \\nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \\nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \\nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \\nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \\nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i\\'m sure , it\\'s so cheesy that it probably won\\'t bother most people . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \\nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \\ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \\nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it\\'s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \\ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ;

\\ngo clubbing ! \\nsure , that makes sense . \\narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \\nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \\neven though frankie page\\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \\neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \\nfather andrew\\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \\nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i\\'ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \\ntrust me , i\\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \\nwhat\\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \\nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n',\n",
       " 'john boorman\\'s \" zardoz \" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . \\nnot since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . \\nof course , wood\\'s career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . \\nboorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain \" zardoz \" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful \" exorcist ii : the heretic \" ) . \\nboorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn\\'t know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . \\nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece \" deliverance \" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama \" hope and glory \" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic \" excalibur \" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure \" the emerald forest \" ( 1985 ) . \\nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . \\nif boorman is anything , he\\'s ambitious , and when he succeeds , it\\'s in grand fashion . \\nunfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . \\n \" zardoz \" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman\\'s . \\nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even \" the wizard of oz , \" a book which figures into the movie\\'s plot . \\nbut , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . \\nthe events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . \\nin fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . \\nit\\'s more middle ages than space age . \\nthe world of \" zardoz \" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . \\nthese immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . \\nhowever , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . \\nif someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . \\none of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . \\nlike \" the wizard of oz , \" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . \\n ( this flying head is one of the movie\\'s opening images , and it\\'s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) \\ncalling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can\\'t procreate and take up more resources . \\nfrom inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , \" the gun is good . \\nthe penis is evil . \" \\nthat line alone is worth the movie\\'s cult following . \\none day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz\\'s flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . \\nonce there , the immortals label him a \" brutal \" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . \\nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . \\ni say \" hilarious \" because that is exactly what \" zardoz \" is . \\nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn\\'t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . \\njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . \\nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . \\nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor . \\nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . \\nhe got exactly that in \" zardoz , \" and it\\'s a wonder it didn\\'t end his career . \\ni\\'m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . \\nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? \\nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? \\nor is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? \\nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . \\ncome to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . \\npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . \\n',\n",

      " ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \n",
      "and the pacing of the story was brisk . \n",
      "there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \n",
      "one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \n",
      "there's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \n",
      "it's a quick , straight shot to the movie's end . \n",
      "in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . \n",
